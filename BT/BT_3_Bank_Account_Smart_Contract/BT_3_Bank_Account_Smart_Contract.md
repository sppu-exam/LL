Here's how to set up and implement a smart contract for a bank account on a test network. This smart contract will handle basic operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. I'll walk you through the setup using Solidity, the Ethereum test network (using tools like Ganache or a testnet like Ropsten), and the Truffle development environment.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm**: Install Node.js and npm if they’re not already installed.
- **Truffle**: Install Truffle, a popular framework for Ethereum development.
- **Ganache**: Use Ganache to simulate a blockchain on your local machine (or connect to a testnet).
- **MetaMask**: MetaMask extension for connecting and managing your Ethereum wallet.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Truffle** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```
2. **Install Ganache** for creating a local Ethereum blockchain environment. You can download it [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

#### Step 2: Initialize a New Truffle Project

1. **Create a new project** and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir BankAccountProject
   cd BankAccountProject
   truffle init
   ```

2. **Create a new contract file** in the `contracts` folder. Name it `BankAccount.sol`.

#### Step 3: Write the Smart Contract in Solidity

Here’s the Solidity code for the bank account smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BankAccount {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    // Event to emit when a deposit is made
    event Deposit(uint amount, uint newBalance);
    // Event to emit when a withdrawal is made
    event Withdraw(uint amount, uint newBalance);

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // Set the contract deployer as the owner
    }

    // Modifier to allow only the owner to call certain functions
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    // Deposit function to add funds to the account
    function deposit() external payable {
        balance += msg.value;
        emit Deposit(msg.value, balance);
    }

    // Withdraw function to remove funds from the account
    function withdraw(uint _amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(_amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance.");
        balance -= _amount;
        payable(owner).transfer(_amount);
        emit Withdraw(_amount, balance);
    }

    // Function to check the account balance
    function getBalance() external view returns (uint) {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Compile the Smart Contract

1. **Navigate to the project directory** and compile the contract:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

   This will create the compiled contract in the `build/contracts` directory.

### Step 5: Configure the Truffle Network

1. Open `truffle-config.js` and add the following configuration for your network (e.g., Ganache or Ropsten):

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     networks: {
       development: {
         host: "127.0.0.1",
         port: 7545,       // Ganache default port
         network_id: "*"   // Match any network id
       },
       ropsten: {
         provider: () =>
           new HDWalletProvider("YOUR_MNEMONIC", "https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"),
         network_id: 3,       // Ropsten network id
         gas: 5500000,        // Ropsten gas limit
       }
     },
     compilers: {
       solc: {
         version: "^0.8.0",
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_MNEMONIC"` with your wallet mnemonic and `"YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"` with your Infura project ID if you’re using Ropsten.

### Step 6: Deploy the Smart Contract

1. **Create a migration script** to deploy the contract. In the `migrations` folder, create a new file named `2_deploy_bank_account.js`:

   ```javascript
   const BankAccount = artifacts.require("BankAccount");

   module.exports = function (deployer) {
     deployer.deploy(BankAccount);
   };
   ```

2. **Deploy the contract** on the configured network:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

   If you’re deploying to Ropsten, replace `development` with `ropsten`.

### Step 7: Interact with the Smart Contract

You can interact with the deployed contract using Truffle’s console:

1. **Open the Truffle console**:
   ```bash
   truffle console --network development
   ```

2. **Get the deployed contract instance**:
   ```javascript
   let bank = await BankAccount.deployed();
   ```

3. **Deposit Money**:
   ```javascript
   await bank.deposit({ value: web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether"), from: YOUR_ADDRESS });
   ```

4. **Withdraw Money**:
   ```javascript
   await bank.withdraw(web3.utils.toWei("0.5", "ether"), { from: YOUR_ADDRESS });
   ```

5. **Show Balance**:
   ```javascript
   let balance = await bank.getBalance();
   console.log("Balance:", web3.utils.fromWei(balance, "ether"), "ETH");
   ```

### Step 8: Testing the Contract

1. **Create a test file** in the `test` folder named `BankAccount.test.js`:

   ```javascript
   const BankAccount = artifacts.require("BankAccount");

   contract("BankAccount", (accounts) => {
     let bankInstance;

     before(async () => {
       bankInstance = await BankAccount.deployed();
     });

     it("should deposit money", async () => {
       await bankInstance.deposit({ from: accounts[0], value: web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether") });
       const balance = await bankInstance.getBalance();
       assert.equal(balance.toString(), web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether"));
     });

     it("should withdraw money", async () => {
       await bankInstance.withdraw(web3.utils.toWei("0.5", "ether"), { from: accounts[0] });
       const balance = await bankInstance.getBalance();
       assert.equal(balance.toString(), web3.utils.toWei("0.5", "ether"));
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

### Step 9: Deploy on a Public Test Network (Optional)

To deploy on a testnet like Ropsten, make sure you have the required funds in your MetaMask wallet, configure the Ropsten network in `truffle-config.js`, and migrate your contract as shown in Step 6.

This setup allows you to manage deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks on a test network, simulating a simple bank account system in a decentralized environment.
